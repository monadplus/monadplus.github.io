Hi! Name's Arnau Abella. I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona (Spain). I finished my master's degree in Computer Science at [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.fib.upc.edu/) in 2022. A copy of my master's thesis _"Distributed Complex Event Recognition"_ can be found [here](/assets/documents/thesis.pdf). I work at [coinweb.io](https://coinweb.io/) building a cross-chain computational platform.

My main interests are programming language theory, type theory and compilers. I also have a strong interest in functional programming. Haskell specially, which I use daily for my open source projects. I have [several projects](https://github.com/monadplus?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=haskell) written in Haskell. I am also the author of a [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) library called [rbst](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rbst). At work, I used daily both Haskell and Rust.

## Projects

- [DCORE](https://github.com/dtim-upc/DCORE), a distributed complex event recognition engine
- [rbst](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rbst), randomized binary trees for Haskell
- [cpp-lang](https://github.com/monadplus/CPP-lang), a toy programming language written in Haskell
- [twitch-game](https://github.com/monadplus/twitch-game/), backend for _Otter Chaos Repair_(hackaton game)
- [equality](https://monadplus.github.io/equality/), a test utility library for Scala

## Talks

- [Generic Programming in Scala with Shapeless](https://github.com/monadplus/intro-shapeless)
- [Lenses in Scala with Monacle](https://github.com/monadplus/scala-lenses)
- [Parallelism and Concurrency in Haskell](https://github.com/monadplus/parconc-notes/tree/main/talk)

## My working setup

I usually work on a high-end desktop (Intel i7-12700KF, Nvidia RTX 3060ti, 32GB of RAM, 2TB of SSD...) with proper peripherals and ergonomic desk. When I am travelling, I work on a Thinkpad p14s.

All my computers run on [Arch](https://github.com/monadplus/dotfiles) (I used to run [NixOS](https://github.com/monadplus/nixconfig), but I decide to move to Arch for several reasons). My editor of choice is [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
