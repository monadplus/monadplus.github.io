My name is Arnau Abella. I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona (Spain). I have been developing software profesionally since 2017 and graduated as M.Sc. in Computer Science ([_"Distributed Complex Event Recognition"_](/assets/documents/thesis.pdf)) at [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.fib.upc.edu/) in 2022.

I specialized in backend development and worked in several interesting projects including:
- A cross-chain computational platform.
- A payment gateway.
- A real-time routing algorithm.
- A knowledge management system for museums.
- A smart remote controller for industrial cold rooms.
