My name is Arnau Abella. I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona (Spain). I have been developing software profesionally since 2017 and graduated as M.Sc. in Computer Science ([_"Distributed Complex Event Recognition"_](/assets/documents/thesis.pdf)) at [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.fib.upc.edu/) in 2022.

I specialized in backend development and worked in several interesting projects including:

My working environment:
- I have been working remotly for over 6 years.
- I usually work from home on a high-end desktop (compile-times are important!) with proper peripherals and ergonomic desk. Furthermore, I always have an updated laptop (Thinkpad p14s) prepared for travelling!
- All my computers run [Arch](https://archlinux.org/)(linux) with a highly customized workflow.
- My editor of choice is [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (see [configuration](https://github.com/monadplus/nvim))
