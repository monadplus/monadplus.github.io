Hi! My name's Arnau Abella. I'm a software engineer living in Barcelona.

I finished my master's degree in Computer Science at [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.fib.upc.edu/) in 2022. A copy of my master's thesis _"Distributed Complex Event Recognition"_ can be found [here](/assets/documents/thesis.pdf). I work at [coinweb.io](https://coinweb.io/) building a cross-chain computational platform.

My main interests are programming language theory and compilers. 
I have a strong interest in functional programming, Haskell in particular.
I have [several projects](https://github.com/monadplus?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=haskell) written in Haskell. A hackage library: [rbst](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rbst). And I use Haskell and Rust daily at work.

All my computers run [Arch](https://github.com/monadplus/dotfiles) or [NixOS](https://github.com/monadplus/nixconfig). My editor of choice is Emacs. I have two thinkpads: T495 and p14s. My powerstation runs a i7-12700KF and a Nvidia 3060ti. My keyboard and mouse are: [Keyboardio Model 01](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/model-01-keyboard?variant=30996744405065) and [Kensington Expert Trackball](https://www.kensington.com/p/products/electronic-control-solutions/trackball-products/expert-mouse-wireless-trackball-1/).
