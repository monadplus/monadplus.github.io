Hi! I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona, Spain.

I am currently working on my master's thesis _Distributed Complex Event Patterns_ at [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.fib.upc.edu/).
I am also working part-time at [coinweb.io](https://coinweb.io/).

I have a strong interest in functional programming, Haskell in particular.
My main interests are programming language theory and compilers.
In my spare time, I enjoy playing with dependently typed languages, most notably Agda.
